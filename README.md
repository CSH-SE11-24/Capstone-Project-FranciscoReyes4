This website is supposed to be a recreation of ticketmaster.Where you buy tickest for sports events concerts,plays etc.The index.html contains the home page with different tickets and you even got a sign in page.
Concerts.html is where you can buy tickets for music events.
Arts.html is where you can buy tickets for plays.
sports.html is where you can buy tickets for sporting events and the css was just changing the text color.I also Used DOM Manipulation to fix the little text and to make the images change when you go over them.

Bootstrap changed my programming epxerience because I feel like putting all these components and images just made coding way more easier.Same thing with DOM manipulation it made small changes but it made the images look better.

I followed the MVP plan all the way and the website came out good,I made sure I had very good progress every day so it can be up to date.

I am the most proud of the links going through with the images very smoothly.I am also proud that like the images of the cards start to change when you interact with it.

If I had more time I would have probably added more DOM manipulation or like maybe have added like alot more text or maybe buttons.Something that I could use it with DOM.
